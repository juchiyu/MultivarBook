## Mulitvariate analyses vs. Univariate anlyses

What are multivariate analyses? 
Component-based multivariate methods are primarily data driven exploratory techniques of the underlying structure (i.e. latent structure) of a multivariate data set. These underlying structers are represted by a mixture of the original variables---called components or factors---which explain the most information about your observations.

When would I use multivariate instead of univariate analyses?
1. When you want to understand the relationship between multiple (2 +) outcome variables/measurements. 

Note a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) with two variables would be the same as a pearson correlation (r). 

2. Exploratory data analysis, when you don't have *a priori* hypotheses about the structure of your data. 

Example: You are using a large archival data set that includes multiple behavioral measurements (i.e., surveys, performance data, etc).

3. Dimention reduction

Example: Machine learning 

4. Identify unique patterns across observations 

Example: Eigen faces (maybe), time series data, functional PCA 

-Univariate statistics are most appropriate to use when you have one outcome or measured variable and have planned inferences based on *a priori* hypotheses.  

## Common methods in multivariate analysis

Insert table of commonly used mulitvariate analyses and the type of data needed to conduct said analysis 
Rows: one table, two table, and multi-table (2+) analyses for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed data sets 
Columns: Variable/data, Analysis, Results/output

note we can use this table as a kind of index for people to find the type of analysis they should do based on the type of data they are wanting to analyses
```{r echo=TRUE results='asis'}
library(knitr)

TableCols <- c("Type of Data", "Analysis", "Results") 
SingleTable <- c("Quantitiative", "PCA", )

kable(x = ,col.names = TableCols ,caption = "Comparison between Multivariate and Univariate Analyses")
```
